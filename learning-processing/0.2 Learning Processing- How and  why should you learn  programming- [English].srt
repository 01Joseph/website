1
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:04,102
Okay, so let's ask the question:

2
00:00:05,002 --> 00:00:09,011
Why should you learn to program the 
computer?

3
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:12,074
and really, but, you know, we would first
 have to admit that

4
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:15,463
the answer to that question might be "Hello, no

5
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:19,130
I don't need to do this I'm interested 
in lots of stuff

6
00:00:19,013 --> 00:00:23,051
and this does not interest me," and that's
 pretty reasonable, I mean first of all

7
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:26,147
you should make sure you go outside, run
 around, physical exercise is very

8
00:00:27,047 --> 00:00:27,130
important,

9
00:00:28,003 --> 00:00:31,322
food is delicious, talking to people is 
wonderful

10
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,770
I don't know, hobbies, I like playing
 cards, I like musical theatre, I don't necessarily need

11
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,129
programming for those things

12
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:41,043
so you, you can go and have a very full 
life

13
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:45,672
and just stop these videos and really be a 
happy person. At the same time,

14
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:50,280
let's just make, let's just, let's just 
admit something: you probably use the

15
00:00:50,028 --> 00:00:50,109
computer a lot.

16
00:00:51,009 --> 00:00:54,208
you probably, it's probably a tool for

17
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,340
work, family,

18
00:00:57,034 --> 00:01:01,093
social, you use it, right, and 
how do you use it, let's say you've never written a line

19
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:01,152
of code

20
00:01:02,052 --> 00:01:05,064
before in your life. You probably do things
 like you use

21
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:08,122
Chrome, or you use Photoshop,

22
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:13,077
or you use Word, we could keep

23
00:01:13,077 --> 00:01:16,134
making a long list of stuff there. What
 are all these things?

24
00:01:17,034 --> 00:01:20,056
Software! Who made these things?

25
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:23,545
Not you, right? So, you know, they're great!

26
00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,420
Photoshop is really good and an 
amazing piece of software

27
00:01:27,042 --> 00:01:30,139
made by very large company and lots of people and you need Photoshop,

28
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:34,198
you have an image, you wanna get rid of the 
red eye

29
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:38,450
you wanna make it brighter you wanna do 
some kind of, I don't know, filter on it to make

30
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:38,122
it look like it was

31
00:01:39,022 --> 00:01:42,100
taken thirty years ago, I don't know if Photoshop does that,

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,004
you use Photoshop, but there are limits to what
Photoshop can do

33
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,068
it is a tool with a set of features that
are provided

34
00:01:51,068 --> 00:01:53,093
to you via an interface and you

35
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:56,106
can't make it do more that it does and
in fact

36
00:01:57,006 --> 00:02:00,071
if you want to be creative if you wanna
develop your own

37
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:03,106
ideas whether they're art or

38
00:02:04,006 --> 00:02:07,067
a commercial product or some just weird
strange exploration

39
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:10,119
you don't wanna, you don't wanna be
limited by the tools that are provided

40
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:11,067
for you

41
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:15,138
you want to start with a blank slate, you
 know, if you want to create a new image

42
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:18,079
processing filter that doesn't exist

43
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:21,128
you could do that. In this video
series

44
00:02:22,028 --> 00:02:25,070
you will learn to do that, and it's not very hard!

45
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:29,071
I mean, there are aspects of programming that
are incredibly hard this won't be easy

46
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,082
don't get me wrong

47
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:35,155
but this is really what we're talking
about here everything that you do

48
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:40,070
whether it's working with images, 
working with animation,

49
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:43,059
writing, checking your email,

50
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:48,026
interfacing with hardware, robotics,

51
00:02:48,026 --> 00:02:52,091
everything that you do digitally starts 
from somewhere, somebody wrote the

52
00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:53,119
software to make this stuff

53
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,057
work why couldn't that person be you
what types of things could you invent

54
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:01,072
what types of ideas could you come up with
if you weren't limited

55
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:04,077
to the list of tools that you can 
download, purchase,

56
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:10,035
and get from, you know, other individuals
 might have released as open source or big

57
00:03:10,035 --> 00:03:10,116
companies,

58
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:14,078
let's break all those bonds, 
let's write your own software, and that sounds

59
00:03:14,078 --> 00:03:14,156
very grand

60
00:03:15,056 --> 00:03:18,137
and ridiculous and then we're gonna be like
and now what you're gonna learn is

61
00:03:19,037 --> 00:03:23,043
there's a red circle on the screen and
it moves back and forth so don't me wrong,

62
00:03:23,043 --> 00:03:25,118
this is going to be a slow process this
is really just the beginning

63
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:29,057
I'm gonna show you some basic stuff you're
gonna have to take it much farther

64
00:03:29,057 --> 00:03:32,066
but this will get you started in that
direction if you

65
00:03:32,066 --> 00:03:36,895
and hopefully will be great
now there's also the question, if this is maybe

66
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:39,400
why you should learn, how you should learn

67
00:03:39,004 --> 00:03:42,042
that's a more complicated one

68
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:45,867
I'm not prepared to answer it, I'm just gonna try
as best I can

69
00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:50,500
to communicate to you and provide
resources but again this just brings up the

70
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:52,047
question there are so many resources
online

71
00:03:52,092 --> 00:03:55,183
that are terrific there are online course
s you could take there's code Academy

72
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,122
there's the Khan Academy there's Udacity

73
00:03:59,022 --> 00:04:02,034
there's schools you can go to there's a new

74
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:07,062
experimental school called the School
 for Poetic Computation that's opening

75
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:10,088
there's lots of stuff out there so this
is just a little resource

76
00:04:10,088 --> 00:04:14,103
through video, I'll try to supplement it with
code examples online

77
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:19,020
with links below the video I might
hopefully create a site with some other

78
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:21,004
tools at some point but right now

79
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:24,103
me talking, examples you can download, 
diagrams,

80
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:28,095
but there is something I think
is important to mention here which is 

81
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:30,141
a lot of the tools that you might - first of all,

82
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,520
you know what's a nice way to learn? Find a 
friend,

83
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,280
find someone you don't even know, sit in a room with other people

84
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,029
try to program with them, ask them
 questions, look at what they're doing, try

85
00:04:41,029 --> 00:04:42,718
to explain your program to a friend,

86
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:48,220
be with people, right, we can all try to
design the most fancy, best whatever

87
00:04:48,022 --> 00:04:48,107
online

88
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:52,074
tool that will like show you the steps
 and give you immediate feedback and step

89
00:04:52,074 --> 00:04:53,135
you through give you this exercise and

90
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:57,043
give you all this, right, but being
with people

91
00:04:57,043 --> 00:05:01,085
and talking to people talking through
your ideas, that is probably the best way

92
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:02,181
to learn, now that's not what's happening
here

93
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:07,087
I'm by myself which is a little bit
weird but I'm getting used to it

94
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:10,386
a lot more used to it than I 
was before

95
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:15,120
but one thing I will say also that's a
little bit different here is a lot of

96
00:05:15,012 --> 00:05:15,081
the tools

97
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,156
and courses, you know, that you might take
whether it's a high school class a

98
00:05:19,056 --> 00:05:21,062
college class an online class

99
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:24,136
firstof all they might have the word "Computer Science" in them -

100
00:05:25,036 --> 00:05:29,215
Computer Science is a really
great

101
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:32,800
field of research and study of the
 science of computing,

102
00:05:32,008 --> 00:05:35,011
this is not that, we're just learning
about computation

103
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:39,088
how to write programming, how to write code, 
how to program and applying it

104
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:42,121
to whatever you might be interested in
, are you interested in Biology and could

105
00:05:43,021 --> 00:05:45,072
the tools of computation help you there? Are you interested in music

106
00:05:45,072 --> 00:05:48,075
and could the tools of computation be
 something you could use

107
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:50,010
with music and

108
00:05:50,001 --> 00:05:53,086
this is the other thing, that I don't have a test
for you to take

109
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:54,099
don't have something to say like

110
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:57,123
"and you will make this" when you're
finished with these videos the point

111
00:05:58,023 --> 00:05:59,024
of these videos

112
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:03,030
is for you to have a creative idea and
you don't have to have that now

113
00:06:03,003 --> 00:06:06,024
you might get inspired or try experiment
s and it doesn't have to have any

114
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,080
practical value, now

115
00:06:07,008 --> 00:06:11,055
you might want to get a job which I think is important in a lot of ways,

116
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,053
but you might also just

117
00:06:13,053 --> 00:06:17,066
feel like "I like sorbet,

118
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:20,093
and I like bugs,

119
00:06:20,093 --> 00:06:24,125
particularly spiders, and I'm going to create 
a simulation of spiders eating sorbet,"

120
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:28,054
which actually makes no sense
whatsoever but that's the point

121
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,058
you might have some idea that apparently
doesn't have any practical value that

122
00:06:31,094 --> 00:06:34,099
makes any sense but you just want to
explore it could be a visual idea

123
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:38,099
a it could be a musical idea could be a
 website, an app,

124
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,180
you know, this isn't really going to
be about making products and apps

125
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:44,012
and stuff for the web, as you're gonna see, as 
much

126
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:49,133
but the point is you will develop your own ideas and make

127
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:50,087
them and

128
00:06:50,087 --> 00:06:53,103
hopefully share them with others in some 
way, so

129
00:06:54,003 --> 00:06:58,014
I will try to
give little exercises and little

130
00:06:58,014 --> 00:06:59,051
questions

131
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:03,089
and push in particular directions but
how you will learn in this particular

132
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,091
context

133
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:08,160
will be about coming up with your own
creative project ideas and using the

134
00:07:09,006 --> 00:07:10,034
tools of computation

135
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:14,155
to realize those ideas and hopefully that
will be a nice thing.

136
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:18,100
If anybody has success with that and finds it

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,008
useful I'd be thrilled to know. Okay, so
that's the end of

138
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:26,457
this particular introductory video and I
think the

139
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,554
next one is, I'm going to talk about

140
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,783
actually "What is programming, what does 
it mean to write, what is programming,

141
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,267
what is an algorithm, what does it mean
to program

142
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:35,144
the computer?"
