1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,074
Okay, look, let's take a step back for a
second

2
00:00:03,074 --> 00:00:06,089
and let me introduce myself a little
more properly.

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,095
My name is (this is absurd but I'm writing
my name over here

4
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:12,654
on the board but) my name is [enunciating]
Daniel Sheef Mon

5
00:00:13,509 --> 00:00:17,330
pronounced 'Shiffman'

6
00:00:17,033 --> 00:00:20,042
but I don't know, you can say Sheef Mon
if you want

7
00:00:20,042 --> 00:00:24,651
and I work at a place called ITP which
you can find out more about

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:25,800
ITP.nyu.edu

9
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:28,054
It's a two-year graduate program and I

10
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:32,073
teach a lot of programming courses here,
One of which

11
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,095
in particular is a course called
'Introduction

12
00:00:35,095 --> 00:00:38,454
to Computational Media' in which the students 

13
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:43,800
learn - most them for the very first time -
how to program the computer

14
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:47,033
and we use for that course something
else that I participate

15
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:54,444
in developing, called, 'Processing,' and you
can find out more about Processing

16
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:58,587
at Processing.org so this is who I am
the kind of context, at least, of what I'm

17
00:00:59,469 --> 00:00:59,930
doing

18
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:03,175
I imagine I'm making these videos just to
try them, to learn more about teaching -

19
00:01:04,075 --> 00:01:07,096
to learn more about teaching in
this strange

20
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:12,111
new context as well as to supplement the
course that I'm teaching here

21
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,084
but it is my hope that all the things
will kind of feed into each other in a nice

22
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:19,149
way and that there will be some
population, however small, whether it's

23
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:23,090
three people - three hundred - three
thousand - three billion - that are

24
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:26,065
interested in this content and that this
stuff that I'm going to talk about

25
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:30,064
and demonstrate over many many many many
many videos

26
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:33,069
on will be interesting to help you
with - [humorously] I don't know -

27
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:38,043
I'm really trying too hard to justify this, but
I'm just doing it, you can turn it off at

28
00:01:38,043 --> 00:01:41,059
anytime you like. Okay now, who are you?

29
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:44,268
I don't know. I would be interested in
hearing from you.

30
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,210
But let me say a few things: this video
series

31
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:51,022
is for the complete and total beginner.

32
00:01:51,031 --> 00:01:52,080
You don't need to know anything.

33
00:01:52,008 --> 00:01:55,017
That's not entirely true. You do need to
access to a computer -

34
00:01:55,089 --> 00:01:57,168
you probably already do if you're
watching this video - you need to know

35
00:01:58,068 --> 00:01:58,157
some basic stuff:

36
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:02,058
how to download a piece of software, how to
install it,

37
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:05,082
yeah, how to type - that kind of stuff
but really that's it.

38
00:02:05,082 --> 00:02:09,083
I will assume no knowledge whatsoever
about anything that has to do with

39
00:02:09,083 --> 00:02:09,161
programming.

40
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:13,067
we're going to really, really slowly in
great detail

41
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:16,081
build-up stuff from the beginning.

42
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:19,176
So if you already know some stuff about
programming, the nice thing about these

43
00:02:20,076 --> 00:02:21,170
video series is I'm trying to keep the videos

44
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,076
to between 2 and 20 minutes.

45
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,090
really I want them to be like 5 or 10 minute videos
but you can just skip some

46
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:32,011
You can jump ahead. If all you're
interested in how to, like, parse

47
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:37,035
a JSON feed and get it into your Processing sketch,
that's probably going to be video, like, number 50

48
00:02:37,044 --> 00:02:37,051
or 30

49
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:41,028
or 22 - somewhere further
ahead

50
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:44,100
(it's not made yet, by the way. It doesn't exist)
but you can jump ahead and do that.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,001
The other thing I should mention it I made some
videos last year

52
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,006
so as you're watching them if you suddenly
think that I look much younger

53
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:55,053
or have a strangely different length of beard,

54
00:02:55,053 --> 00:02:59,055
it's because some of the videos from last year are going
to be kind of spliced in here although I may end

55
00:02:59,055 --> 00:02:59,094
up

56
00:02:59,094 --> 00:03:03,142
remaking them if they're out-of-date
or needing some

57
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:07,073
extra touch-up - or that sort of thing.

58
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:10,091
So that's who I am. That's who you are -

59
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:12,152
- or maybe you are, and you can let me know if
you are somebody different.
