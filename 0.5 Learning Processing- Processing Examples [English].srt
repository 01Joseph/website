1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:03,030
ok so where where where is your head at

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:06,982
I'm not really sure but maybe now you have a
sense of okay I kinda get what

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,280
programming is

4
00:00:08,028 --> 00:00:11,079
I've gotta write instructions with a
specific syntax

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,141
and I could choose all these different
languages and all these different

6
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:16,067
environments for different kinds of
applications and

7
00:00:16,067 --> 00:00:19,146
for different operating system and for
different hardware but here

8
00:00:20,046 --> 00:00:24,048
we're going to use processing what
advantages does

9
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:28,195
processing give us what kinds of things
can we make with processing what is the

10
00:00:28,789 --> 00:00:30,570
lens that we're gonna look through

11
00:00:30,057 --> 00:00:33,059
to learn the fundamental concepts a
programming this is key

12
00:00:33,077 --> 00:00:36,526
we're not I'm not it's not my intention
here for you

13
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,680
to learn processing it's my intention
for you to learn

14
00:00:40,068 --> 00:00:44,125
the fundamental tools of computation
we're going to use processing as the

15
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:46,091
environment to learn those tools

16
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:49,092
but those tools those concepts will go
across

17
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,010
any programming language environment
that you choose to use in the future

18
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:57,002
so why- as I said processing we- it's a thing
we download

19
00:00:57,011 --> 00:01:00,042
we can open it- one of the first things
you might do yourself

20
00:01:00,042 --> 00:01:03,067
and I'll kinda do this for you is take a
look through the examples

21
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:06,079
so you can see here there's a little
window that you can pop up that has

22
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,153
examples

23
00:01:07,053 --> 00:01:10,082
and you can kinda look through look
these basics and some of these basic things

24
00:01:10,082 --> 00:01:10,181
will give you a sense of

25
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:15,134
what is processing doing. you can learn about
color, you can learn about form, you can learn

26
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:16,853
about math

27
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,650
so if for example I just go here and
lets say we wanna learn about hue

28
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:24,070
with processing I can run this
particular example

29
00:01:24,007 --> 00:01:27,016
and you can see that what it's doing
here is as I move the mouse back and

30
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,121
forth across the screen

31
00:01:29,021 --> 00:01:32,025
its changing the hue of the color that
I'm drawing

32
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:37,117
so there's a range of examples and you'll
notice these examples, generally speaking

33
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,021
have a visual design component so

34
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:44,038
if you're interested in design, animation,

35
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:47,079
images, creative applications of
software,

36
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:50,144
processing is a good environment to
explore ideas in that area

37
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,101
Umm another thing and I'm just
gonna kinda give you a quick range

38
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,063
as you look through you might start to
look through a lot the examples under

39
00:01:58,063 --> 00:01:58,147
topics:

40
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:03,093
and one of the ones that's sure dear to
my heart that you might look at is OK

41
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:06,162
simulate so there's a lot of nice
examples we can look at

42
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:10,115
this idea on what- of simulating

43
00:02:11,015 --> 00:02:14,021
physics elements through processing you can see there are
some circles on the screen

44
00:02:14,075 --> 00:02:17,120
as I click them and move them with the
house- my head is always- clearly this is very

45
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:18,057
poorly

46
00:02:18,075 --> 00:02:21,107
what I'm doing here. Umm they there they
have this

47
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:25,104
spring-like motion so one of the nice
things about processing is there's a-

48
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:29,007
when you downloaded it, there's a wide range
examples and to get a sense of

49
00:02:29,034 --> 00:02:32,086
what can I do, what are some ideas of
things I might try to make: you could

50
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,177
you could spend a whole day just
clicking through and running all of the

51
00:02:35,077 --> 00:02:35,143
examples

52
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:39,130
Umm the other thing that I would just
mention is that processing

53
00:02:40,003 --> 00:02:44,026
has a in addition to the sort of 2d drawing
engine which allows you to draw

54
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:47,094
simple and and kinda complex shapes and
animations in 2d

55
00:02:47,094 --> 00:02:50,186
you can do a lot of stuff in three
dimensions as well

56
00:02:51,086 --> 00:02:55,134
I guess I'll just open up this one
called Planets

57
00:02:56,034 --> 00:02:59,069
and we can see here's a nice- Whoo this is
beautiful! I'm going to have to use this

58
00:02:59,069 --> 00:02:59,148
for something,

59
00:03:00,048 --> 00:03:03,077
but here we can see, err this err, nice

60
00:03:03,077 --> 00:03:06,173
little demonstration of how you can do
3d rendering in processing as well

61
00:03:07,073 --> 00:03:08,092
err

62
00:03:08,092 --> 00:03:11,189
and you can see err, you can do err-err, all sorts of
different kinds of

63
00:03:12,089 --> 00:03:16,098
camera stuff, lighting stuff, textures: all
things that you might find in a 3d computer graphics environment

64
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,102
that' what you can do

65
00:03:19,002 --> 00:03:22,037
and you can do with the processing
environment as well so

66
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:25,040
this is- I just closed everything

67
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:29,356
that is the examples- the other thing, it's
just something else I really want to

68
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,250
mention about processing

69
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:35,054
so okay so here's something I kinda should
have might have wanted to mention, we

70
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:35,128
have this

71
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:41,047
a show like crazy list of all these
programming languages that I was kinda

72
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:41,122
saying aaah,

73
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:45,079
okay, so here we're using processing and
one thing you might think it's like

74
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,167
oh is it just

75
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:50,083
processing, it like this toy environment
that I can kind of just do a little like experimental

76
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,160
ideas in buit  can't really make

77
00:03:52,006 --> 00:03:56,074
a a large-scale projects with; so one of
the things that I like about processing is

78
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,115
both its ability to allow you to

79
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:02,914
get started very quickly and learn the
basics but also you can build fairly

80
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:05,310
large scale sophisticated projects in it

81
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:08,087
and one of the reasons for this is, is that you
aren't learning the processing language-

82
00:04:08,087 --> 00:04:09,160
yes you're using the oppressing environment

83
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:13,014
yes there is a a set of processing
functions

84
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:17,067
that are that are that are needed for
processing itself but really the language a

85
00:04:18,003 --> 00:04:19,512
that you're writing

86
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:23,490
code in is Java, now Java is probably about right
now, and I refer to the era that we live in,

87
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:26,145
2013, it's probably like the least cool
thing you can learn like

88
00:04:27,045 --> 00:04:31,058
it's much cooler to learn JavaScript or
ruby and and there's lots of great stuff

89
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:31,130
you can do; i mean

90
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:36,055
javascript is especially on the web
now and, erm canvas and webGL

91
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:39,431
all this amazing stuff that I also encourage
you to learn but

92
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,080
there is an advantage to using Java or
the fact that processing is built on top of

93
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,094
Java, er, you know Java is kinda

94
00:04:46,094 --> 00:04:49,149
in many ways I i've heard this said
about Java err

95
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:53,198
something silly, but, it's not the best

96
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,780
language for anything but it does

97
00:04:56,078 --> 00:05:00,113
everything, so if there's anything you're
thinking about doing if you are you wanna

98
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:01,077
like read your

99
00:05:01,077 --> 00:05:04,346
email into your processing program and
then draw little bubbles on the screen

100
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,077
for every email you've received

101
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:09,423
or you want to connect to the Microsoft
Kinect

102
00:05:09,819 --> 00:05:13,410
or you want to use err this physical
piece of this hardware you want to use the

103
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:13,830
sensor

104
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,208
erm, you can really do just about anything
you'll find a java library out there

105
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:22,530
for just about anything so processing
because it's built on Java

106
00:05:22,053 --> 00:05:25,062
is incredibly extendable through
libraries

107
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:31,062
now what are these libraries and you can
see I'm into

108
00:05:31,062 --> 00:05:34,062
if I go back to that examples window erm,

109
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:37,351
looking through those examples 
topics I could go down to start to look at

110
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,982
libraries

111
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,644
one which i'll just demonstrate really
briefly to you right now is video

112
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:46,090
so under capturei'm gonna look at er, one of these

113
00:05:46,009 --> 00:05:49,105
examples; gonna run this mirror example

114
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,094
and I think this will work

115
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:56,173
err, its effect we should edit

116
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,240
it's taking a minute or so here we can
see a look what's interesting is this is

117
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:02,086
a green screen so you can see the green
wall in the actual camera

118
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:06,615
so the camera here is reading my image
so processing can connect to pieces of

119
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,770
hardware through libraries, can connect to
your camera

120
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:13,596
and what this example is doing is it's
taking every single pixel from a regular

121
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:15,690
good old-fashioned image

122
00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:18,106
and instead of drawing that pixel as a

123
00:06:19,006 --> 00:06:23,052
a a- drawing that pixel as a rectangle on
the screen rotated according to the

124
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:24,069
brightness or something

125
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:28,134
so you can see that we can create this
abstract visualization of the data

126
00:06:29,034 --> 00:06:32,035
the color data that's coming in from a
camera this is, err, something we'll

127
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:33,673
explore in great detail

128
00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:38,870
in a future video how to write these
kinda examples how to capture images

129
00:06:38,087 --> 00:06:41,125
how to read pixels, how to draw stuff based on
those pixels; so

130
00:06:42,025 --> 00:06:46,064
be- the video library is something that
comes with processing when you download it

131
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:51,130
but  processing itself has a huge, has a
large community of people making

132
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:54,021
libraries and I downloaded one an
arbitrary one

133
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:57,106
called the Yahoo weather library we can
tell, just open up this example

134
00:06:58,006 --> 00:07:01,012
erm, this library allows you to connect

135
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:04,027
to Yahoo- Yahoo weather data

136
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:07,112
and you can see here that this processing
sketch

137
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:11,070
has grabbed the weather information from
the city of berlin, it's fair, the wind

138
00:07:11,007 --> 00:07:12,023
direction is three

139
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:16,135
10 which must maybe is a err, angle!

140
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:20,071
and, erm, and the wind speed is a eight
kilometers kilo-

141
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:24,089
kilometers- I became French, so
kilometers per hour

142
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:28,113
so you can see then this others these
particles these dots that are drawn on the screen

143
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:31,057
that are moving according to that wind
direction: so

144
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:35,058
connecting to data sources there if you
have an idea for something and processing

145
00:07:35,058 --> 00:07:35,157
doesn't do it

146
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:42,098
if you can write the Java code for that
you can make it into a library and you

147
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:43,150
can do it in processing so

148
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,061
the processing is tremendously extendable
through all sorts of libraries, if you want to get a

149
00:07:48,006 --> 00:07:48,059
sense

150
00:07:48,059 --> 00:07:51,085
up what the available libraries are for
you, er,

151
00:07:51,085 --> 00:07:55,116
if we go back to the processing website
waa- and go to libraries

152
00:07:56,016 --> 00:07:59,069
you can see there is a nice list of tons
and tons

153
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,076
libraries and you can also get them,
which I-I- this is err,

154
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,111
through, err, through this library
manager that comes with

155
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:12,040
processing software itself so we can go
through this list of

156
00:08:12,004 --> 00:08:15,040
libraries and if I want this library
which is

157
00:08:15,076 --> 00:08:18,103
a lightweight library for creating
animations and trans-

158
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:22,066
transitions I can click Install and it will
install that library I can use it

159
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:25,088
in my code- okay! so this is kinda

160
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:29,126
at least a little bit of, erm, me getting
started showing you-

161
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,091
okay! here's the process development
environment. here are

162
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:37,096
some the examples, here some libraries, here's
the kind of things that can do

163
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:40,735
and next thing I wanna kinda briefly
look at is just a quick range of some

164
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:42,320
projects

165
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:45,033
that have been made with processing to
get you thinking about

166
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:49,110
looking at erm, larger-scale
installations and animations and and

167
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:51,002
things that people are doing

168
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:54,098
the first project I'm going to show you
what's called Chronograph by Casey Reas, one of the

169
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:55,163
creators of processing and

170
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,110
Tal Rosner, I apologize if I've
pronounced the name

171
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:03,088
here incorrectly, erm, this is a project

172
00:09:03,097 --> 00:09:06,101
which I'll skip to the end
here to just show you this

173
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:10,017
time-lapse. you can see this is a projection
piece

174
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,112
that's projected onto the side of this
building which is

175
00:09:13,012 --> 00:09:16,015
New World Center in Miami Florida for
the New World Symphony so

176
00:09:16,042 --> 00:09:19,055
this is the time lapse of the piece
running, this is showing it more quickly but

177
00:09:19,055 --> 00:09:20,094
you can see this idea of

178
00:09:20,094 --> 00:09:23,108
abstract visuals projected on the side
of the building

179
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:28,035
this is all generative, procedural this is
a piece of software that generates this

180
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:28,101
content

181
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:32,080
that's projected on the side of a building,
this is something that's done a lot with

182
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:35,330
processing, erm, I, a

183
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:38,090
I teach a class here at ITP where the
students create work for a large video

184
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:38,077
wall

185
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:43,102
erm, here are a couple of examples of projects.
there, this is a project called Beluga

186
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:47,058
I'm skipping the sound but this was a
dance performance and

187
00:09:47,058 --> 00:09:52,074
you can see that there are these dancers
that are moving and jumping on tramp-

188
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:55,116
trampolines. this a hundred twenty foot
wide video wall, it's about

189
00:09:56,016 --> 00:10:00,019
twelve feet high and the visuals,
regenerative. this

190
00:10:00,019 --> 00:10:03,098
seascape and they responded to the
movement's of these dancers who were

191
00:10:03,098 --> 00:10:04,105
bouncing up and down

192
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:09,010
on trampolines. so this was actually, er, it's
using processing but there are three

193
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:11,127
separate computers running three
processing sketches

194
00:10:12,027 --> 00:10:15,041
each controlling a section of the video
wall so even these types of

195
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,100
large-scale 3d

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,004
performance graphics for performance are
made with processing; another example

197
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:24,081
of this for the same space; this is a
project called replica

198
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,142
which err, err; here

199
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:31,961
there was a dancer live in the space
with the camera pointed at her

200
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,550
and her image was then a projected onto
the wall

201
00:10:35,055 --> 00:10:38,136
and manipulated with a bit- series of
different kinds

202
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:42,515
of time-based effects and there's music,
the dancer

203
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,000
erm, and all happening in real time; all
happening

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,022
err, live.

205
00:10:49,022 --> 00:10:52,029
okay I'm realizing I'm forgetting to mention
people's names but

206
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,033
I will- erm, there'll be links below where you can
find out the- the wonderful people who

207
00:10:56,033 --> 00:10:57,117
made some of these projects so

208
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:01,038
another thing that processing is used a lot
for is for

209
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:05,074
motion graphics. this is a great project
by Molly Schwartz where she did an animation

210
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:08,169
about eels; now err, called err, Bellyful of Eels; 
if you look at this a lot of this

211
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,112
is done with the Afterefffects,

212
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:14,049
err, but here in in in this particular part of
the

213
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,057
the err, animation, these eels that are
actually swimming through this

214
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:23,054
underwater pipe sewer like space; those 
were actually made in processing;

215
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:24,087
rendered out from processing;

216
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:27,123
and incorporated into a larger animation
project and

217
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:31,029
there are lots of wonderful examples
music videos that have been made with

218
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:31,105
processing

219
00:11:32,005 --> 00:11:37,010
err or different types of elements that
you wouldn't want to

220
00:11:37,001 --> 00:11:40,058
hand animate, that need an algorithmic, generative process to,

221
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:43,102
whether it's behaviors or repetition err,

222
00:11:44,002 --> 00:11:47,040
were done with code with processing

223
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:51,100
okay another, err, another co-

224
00:11:52,036 --> 00:11:55,092
like popular use of processing is for
data visualization

225
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:58,143
a I'll show you a well-known project by
Jere Thorpe

226
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:03,049
This here is a visualization it's
grabbing

227
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:06,053
data from Twitter and looking for people
who said, you know

228
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,171
who are very excited about the fact that-
just landed in Hawaii, for example

229
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:14,075
so anyone who posted 'just landed Hawaii'
if it was me- I wish I would have gone to Hawaii,

230
00:12:14,075 --> 00:12:14,167
I've never been there-

231
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,154
but erm, my home location on Twitter will
be New York

232
00:12:19,054 --> 00:12:22,086
Jere- the project parses out

233
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:26,127
the locations New York and Hawaii and the time
that the tweet was posted

234
00:12:27,027 --> 00:12:30,466
and draws a, this kinda arc path from

235
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:35,420
the original location to the landing location so
its a visualization of people posting on

236
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:35,087
twitter

237
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,099
about their flight and you can see
different views there's this kind of

238
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:39,154
like horizontal view now

239
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,070
it's spinning around, all this is done through
code

240
00:12:43,007 --> 00:12:46,009
through an algorithmic process to
visualize this data and you can see

241
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:46,014
kinda

242
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:50,011
ah, erm, well you can't really see that but
ah,

243
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,119
up here  at the top left um this timescale
showing where we are and

244
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:00,608
this er, ah where we are in time. so this is a
a great use of processing and it looks like oh

245
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,650
my goodness this very like complicated
crazy 3d- how I could ever possibly

246
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:05,076
learn how to do this;

247
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:08,162
we're going to start with some very basic
things like how to draw a circle how to

248
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:10,070
move a circle

249
00:13:10,007 --> 00:13:13,014
this is really just doing that also is
just lots of circles,

250
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:18,030
a little bit of 3d, the- what's happening with
those circles is controlled by data

251
00:13:18,066 --> 00:13:21,069
so all this stuff is possible through
learning the

252
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:25,075
foundations of programming and a a
little bit about how to draw- do stuff

253
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:27,074
with computer graphics as well.

254
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:31,149
ah, so I'll I'll- this is a great
project by Mary Wong

255
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:33,105
if you're interested a lot of

256
00:13:34,005 --> 00:13:37,104
wonderful work is being done with
processing to create physical so if you

257
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,570
want to print design

258
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:41,266
I would a checking out the work of Rune Matthiesen
and err,

259
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,240
course he teaches call Printing Code,
there's a tremendous suite of examples of

260
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,493
using computation

261
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:50,360
to generate print designs, err, this is a
project that Mary

262
00:13:50,036 --> 00:13:54,075
Huang made to create a, err, fashion designed

263
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:58,474
through, through a generative process so you
can see here, the mouse- this is a processing

264
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:00,060
sketch running-

265
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:04,045
with the mouse able to draw over the
figure of a, the human form

266
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:07,684
and that and that what the mouse is
drawing is that

267
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:12,130
a mated to geometry, which is used to
generate the,

268
00:14:12,013 --> 00:14:15,088
the design for a dress and Mary actually
created these dresses and

269
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:18,101
physically fabricated them and wore them
as well and so

270
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,032
a lot of stuff can be is being done
processing in terms of, erm

271
00:14:22,032 --> 00:14:25,057
take a look at the work at nervous
system, I'll include a link to that as

272
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:25,112
well

273
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:30,014
for making jewelry designs you can print
stuff- you can generate stuff for a

274
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:32,079
maker bot with processing to do 3d
printing

275
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,086
this is something that you could
explore a as an application that you

276
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:36,578
might-

277
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,680
an idea you might do throughout if
you're following along with all these

278
00:14:40,068 --> 00:14:40,130
videos

279
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:44,003
erm, also doing- a creating a

280
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:47,042
erm, a physical computing interfaces; this
is a project

281
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:51,040
called the mud tub um which

282
00:14:51,004 --> 00:14:54,011
kinda answers that question what's the
thing that you might want to get

283
00:14:54,074 --> 00:14:59,363
least near your computer- a big pile mud,
this is by Tom Gerhard,

284
00:15:00,029 --> 00:15:03,870
on and so this is also kind of interesting to
say like

285
00:15:03,087 --> 00:15:07,162
what you're
learning here might not might not need

286
00:15:08,062 --> 00:15:10,127
to make something that has this really
obvious practical like-

287
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:15,054
I wanna make an app, and I wanna like sell
billions of them become a

288
00:15:15,054 --> 00:15:16,223
zillionaire which actually is

289
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,722
would be nice, but you know anyway
there's more to life than

290
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,220
selling your apps, but err, this you can
see here

291
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:27,027
there's a projection on this tub of mud
which is- the graphics that's being

292
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:27,074
output

293
00:15:27,074 --> 00:15:30,076
is done through processing and
processing is reading

294
00:15:30,076 --> 00:15:33,525
the sensors that are coming back in um
from the mud

295
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:37,800
err, there's actually sensors underneath
the mud that's measuring the weight of the

296
00:15:37,008 --> 00:15:37,060
mud at any

297
00:15:38,032 --> 00:15:42,055
point which allows the the software to
read the topology essentially of the mud

298
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:45,074
and you can see the mud becomes this
controller where

299
00:15:45,074 --> 00:15:48,152
you with your hands you can kind bounce
this ball around if I

300
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:52,114
kinda skip to the end here you can see you
can kinda play this

301
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:56,020
game here on a separate screen by
pressing on the mud

302
00:15:56,002 --> 00:15:59,038
so this idea of making your own physical
computing device

303
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:02,065
your own interface a tub of mud;
another great example of this

304
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,099
is err the scrollable project; I'll just
show you err

305
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:09,103
this is by Filippo Vanucci and you can
see here is his processing

306
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,088
ah, shoot!

307
00:16:13,088 --> 00:16:16,129
which I think err, here is his processing
sketch which

308
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:20,034
a if you look at it, makes this nice ink
effect

309
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,080
so he's created this a sketch

310
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:26,142
and if I click around here you can see
it draws a bunch of dots and it makes this

311
00:16:27,042 --> 00:16:29,085
animation that has this ink like quality to it

312
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:33,183
so what did he use this process sketch
for? he used it to project onto paper

313
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:37,147
and he built sensors to measure how

314
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,141
what that paper's doing. this will become
much more obvious when I show you it in a

315
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,104
project called scrollables.

316
00:16:43,004 --> 00:16:47,083
and you can see these are these devices
that you can scroll the paper and I'll

317
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,112
just skip ahead here

318
00:16:49,012 --> 00:16:52,080
by scrolling back and forth you can
control and animation so of course we're

319
00:16:52,008 --> 00:16:53,066
all familiar with touchscreens

320
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:57,096
a but here we had this physical device

321
00:16:57,096 --> 00:17:00,164
which has real tactile tangible quality. because
real paper that you're scrolling and you

322
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:02,142
can see as you scroll back and forth

323
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:07,056
you can play for example the game pong
and this ink effect was created through

324
00:17:07,056 --> 00:17:10,205
an algorithm in processing and/or a

325
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:13,740
and control through the physical
interface so

326
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:18,126
you know this is very very, err, a really
really quick and dirty kind of- I don't

327
00:17:19,026 --> 00:17:20,355
know if I missed anything

328
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,600
key that I wanted to show you really kinda
quick and dirty, just quick range of

329
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:24,570
projects that

330
00:17:24,057 --> 00:17:27,068
were made in processing. I would also
encourage you to

331
00:17:27,068 --> 00:17:30,159
on the processing website um at

332
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,060
to go take a look at the exhibition so
if you look at the exhibition link

333
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:39,165
there is a ton of projects that you
can see historically you can actually go

334
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:40,070
it's

335
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:45,016
and you can actually go all the way back
if on the bottom here

336
00:17:45,016 --> 00:17:48,032
oh boy,

337
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:51,077
this is getting awkward- at the bottom
here if you click on

338
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:54,132
number one you can actually see stuff
that was posted for the process exhibition

339
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,060
from

340
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,032
over 10 years ago

341
00:17:56,086 --> 00:18:00,107
so this is there's a if you want to kind
of get a sense that the landscape of

342
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:04,060
what this processing do what are the
kinds of things that I'm going to learn

343
00:18:04,006 --> 00:18:07,011
you could walk yourself through the examples
you can look at a bunch of projects that

344
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,017
are made with processing but

345
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:12,090
ultimately the rest of these videos are going
to very

346
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:17,012
slowly by slowly piece by piece walk you
through the fundamentals of programming

347
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:20,122
through a whole lot of graphic examples
and processing and that will help you

348
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:21,113
generate ideas

349
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:25,015
and things that you want that you might
wanna make and that

350
00:18:25,015 --> 00:18:28,051
really well hopefully one more
introductory video to make

351
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:32,082
and that is a video where I'm just going to
talk through kind of the table of contents

352
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:34,091
everything we're gonna go through you
could call it a syllabus if you want to

353
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:35,107
but I'm kind

354
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:40,052
of afraid to do that. so I'm gonna kind of just
give you a quick overview I think this

355
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,071
I'm kinda having a problem with this is
that in the last one to a bit too long

356
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,112
so

357
00:18:44,012 --> 00:18:47,015
and give you a quick overview all the
fundamentals are going to learn

358
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,123
and then we're just gonna dive right in and
get started
