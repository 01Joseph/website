1
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:05,073
hello

2
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:10,074
aaaawk, so awkward

3
00:00:10,083 --> 00:00:12,182
because it's very hard to begin these
things but we're just gonna go right in

4
00:00:13,082 --> 00:00:14,090
and we're going to begin

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:18,091
hello my name is Dan. Perhaps you watched a
video that I’ve been in before or perhaps you haven’t

6
00:00:19,072 --> 00:00:22,134
I don't know how you got here but you're
here I'm here you're here

7
00:00:23,034 --> 00:00:26,643
we're here together there's a wall here, I can write on it

8
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:31,016
there’s gonna be a computer over there. Why are we here
have you ever wanted to learn

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:32,590
programming

10
00:00:32,059 --> 00:00:36,134
have you never even tried to learn
programming? have you never written a line of code

11
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:39,061
before in your life? you have no idea what it
means

12
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,102
to program to write code to create your
own software?

13
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,017
do you want to break free from the bonds

14
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:49,055
of the tools that other people have made for
you?

15
00:00:49,055 --> 00:00:52,384
do you want to write your own, to build your own
software? make your own things from

16
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:52,936
scratch

17
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:56,620
on the computer? If so …

18
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:59,101
this sounds like a sales pitch but really there's
nothing to sell here, you could just leave

19
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:00,080
at any moment

20
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:04,095
but if so you're in the right place! this
is a video series

21
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:08,069
that is going to teach you how to
program

22
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,102
your computer. now how, what kind of, 
what programming language you use, what

23
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:14,741
environment

24
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,180
what it is you want to make, is a huge
giant

25
00:01:18,018 --> 00:01:22,052
mess of stuff. we're gonna do things
in a simple way,

26
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:25,061
I’m gonna talk a lot more about this something
called processing, I'm just going to talk

27
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:26,103
to you

28
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,262
going to draw diagrams, I will
demonstrate for you

29
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:33,920
code examples on this computer over here

30
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:36,321
it's all going to be in video. now

31
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:41,500
you might have some questions like: oh, I
get it, I heard about these things

32
00:01:41,005 --> 00:01:46,024
kinda like a MOOC, I don't know
how to pronounce it, is this a MOOC?

33
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:49,071
it's not a MOOC, could be a MOOC, you could
make it a MOOC

34
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:52,122
but MOOCs are a little bit scary.
this is just some videos

35
00:01:53,022 --> 00:01:57,171
to help you learn. I hope you might find, you
might do this on your own

36
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,405
you might use these in the conference, to
supplement a class you're taking

37
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:04,630
you might be a teacher of some other
people and want to use these videos in

38
00:02:04,063 --> 00:02:04,752
your course

39
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,750
I don't know but I would like them to be
helpful however you think

40
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:12,152
they might be helpful! so the other
thing you might ask is

41
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:17,091
this seems a little weird just talking and drawing
diagrams. you know I hear about all these

42
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:19,142
new fancy interactive online learning

43
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:23,079
test quizzing and I can … You know
that those things are great

44
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:26,608
and I would like to alternately
incorporate

45
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:30,420
some stuff where you could easily look
at the code while I'm

46
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:34,044
demonstrating it, trying things out. the
Khan Academy is doing some fantastic stuff

47
00:02:34,044 --> 00:02:35,128
John Resig and

48
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:39,567
the CS courses, I highly recommend
them, they’re doing a lot of similar stuff

49
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,640
I'm just kinda doing what I know which
is drawing to a whiteboard

50
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:46,151
and using this computing machine

51
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:51,053
to type out examples. they will all be
available for you to download

52
00:02:51,053 --> 00:02:55,232
there's even a book that I will hesitate to
show you that you could use to follow

53
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:56,370
along

54
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:59,058
I'm also going to do some live

55
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:02,103
online live events where I am

56
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:06,102
gonna take calls and answers questions
which is another …

57
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:08,930
I kinda digress here but that's gonna happen
too so

58
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:12,232
that's really, I made some notes
over here and I

59
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:16,072
this is a so far I’ve only been talking for three
minutes, this is my intro video

60
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:20,099
but so if you really just want to get
into the meat of the stuff but you can

61
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:20,970
skip ahead

62
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:23,136
I don't know, I will link to it, I don't
know the video on

63
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,111
number x I haven’t made it but there's a
video you can just jump to which is hey

64
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:31,700
let's start, let’s writw our first line
of code, let's see how everything works

65
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,220
but I'm going to have a few more videos
just kinda talk

66
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:38,031
a little more about who I am, what I
imagine you might use this for,

67
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:41,039
what is programming in perhaps a kind of
general question, what our programming

68
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:44,093
languages is, what you might use that I'm
using, why am I using this one versus that

69
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:44,652
one

70
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,523
wooo … everything's gonna be
okay, I think so

71
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:52,420
so I'm just gonna have a few more
introductory videos, I’ll show you I hopefully

72
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,043
make one where I’ll

73
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,049
show you a bunch of your project that are kinda
that you might think of this

74
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,882
possible outcomes or that relate to the
kinds of things were going to be doing

75
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:00,700
in this

76
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:04,376
a video series so there's a bunch more
intro videos that i'm gonna make, they’ll be

77
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:07,153
short five-minute videos that you can watch,
but at any point

78
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:11,916
you could just stopped completely and go
out, you know chess is a fun game

79
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:15,620
uhm, I don't know

80
00:04:15,062 --> 00:04:18,141
put a basketball is nice, music, learning
to play the violin

81
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,132
I did that for a while, it was very
enjoyable because it's something else

82
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:26,055
or if or you can jump ahead, argh, this
turned off

83
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:29,072
I have a

84
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:32,891
camera turning off problem, or you could
jump ahead and kinda get to the point

85
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,280
where you think you’re ready to go to

86
00:04:35,028 --> 00:04:38,116
okay hopefully it's going to be fine
that’s the end of this video
