1
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:04,870
okay this is the last introductory video

2
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,100
before we get into the actual stuff - it
really is the

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,929
exciting part where you're going to look
at examples, start writing your own code,

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,972
start making stuff, coming up with your
ideas, trying things out -

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,890
before you start making things, I just
want to give you an overview

6
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:22,123
as to what my plan is for all these
videos, so

7
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:27,121
there's a key thing here -
pick up some energy back here, run in

8
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:29,032
place, run in place - okay

9
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:33,038
there's a key thing here. I want these
videos to cover

10
00:00:33,038 --> 00:00:37,127
the fundamentals of computation, the
fundamental building blocks of computer

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:38,190
programming,

12
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:41,118
and really, there is a short list of
things that you need to know and

13
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:44,024
understand, there are these core elements
that will go across

14
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:48,105
any type of software development, creative
coding,

15
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,014
computer science, whatever you want to
call it,

16
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:55,410
writing code on your computer,
and really actually

17
00:00:55,041 --> 00:01:00,089
three categories, so, any computer
program that runs

18
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:04,097
needs to have data associated with it,
right, it needs to store information about

19
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:04,786
itself,

20
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:08,840
colors, you know,

21
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:12,102
sometimes I wish I didn't do this but
just to think about game programming for

22
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:13,010
a second

23
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:16,093
if you were creating the game Space
Invaders

24
00:01:16,093 --> 00:01:19,186
you may need to keep track of the space
ship's position on the screen,

25
00:01:20,086 --> 00:01:23,235
which level is the game on,

26
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:27,530
what's the current players score, there are
elements data

27
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:30,092
that a computer program needs to keep in
mind as it's running, and this is actually

28
00:01:30,092 --> 00:01:31,097
one of the first things

29
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,105
we will learn about which is
this concept of a variable

30
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:38,086
this thing that stores data.

31
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:42,118
In addition, I'm gonna go out over here, in
addition to this idea of a variable which

32
00:01:43,018 --> 00:01:43,050
is an

33
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:46,084
individual piece of data- 

34
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,170
Okay, don't worry, everything's okay, there's
a floor, and I just dropped the cap -

35
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:53,356
in addition to a variable which is
an individual piece of data

36
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:55,200
we're also going to learn about

37
00:01:55,002 --> 00:01:58,038
something called an array, which we
could also think of

38
00:01:58,056 --> 00:02:01,067
as a list, so what about a list of data

39
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:04,946
instead of like a spaceship as an
individual location, what if there are 10

40
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:06,750
enemies on screen

41
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:11,088
could we have a list of enemy locations. So
any computer program needs to store data

42
00:02:11,088 --> 00:02:14,186
we're gonna learn about variables and arrays. The
other thing that we need to really

43
00:02:15,086 --> 00:02:19,155
learn about is this idea of control. How
do we control the flow

44
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:23,994
of a computer program, how do we
control the path by which it takes,

45
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:28,890
right, if the spaceship - I wish I could
think of

46
00:02:28,089 --> 00:02:32,158
something less violent - shoots it
laser

47
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,590
and hits the enemy its score goes up, right,
how do we control that,

48
00:02:37,059 --> 00:02:41,061
how do we
control that process,

49
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:46,114
if the player dropped a seed and a
flower blooms, that's a nicer way of thinking about

50
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:47,473
it, so,

51
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,624
we want to look at this idea of
conditionals, conditional logic,

52
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,090
if statements, if this condition is
met

53
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,026
then the program executes this
instruction, alright,

54
00:02:59,026 --> 00:03:01,835
that's something we're gonna look at.
Another control structure we're gonna

55
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:02,480
look at

56
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,075
is a loop, right, this idea repeating
something

57
00:03:05,075 --> 00:03:08,094
if we have 100 enemy spaceships,

58
00:03:08,094 --> 00:03:11,643
do we want to have a hundred lines of
code - draw spaceship one

59
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,620
draw space ship two, draw space ship three - no, we
want to have this loop

60
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:19,137
draw every spaceship, for every spaceship

61
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:23,716
draw it on the screen, so this is this
idea, really simple, these are these

62
00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:25,124
fundamentals, we're gonna have

63
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:29,560
a set of videos about each one of these -
how do we deal with a variable,

64
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:32,122
how do we deal with a conditional ,how do we
deal with a loop, how do we deal with an

65
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:33,060
array -

66
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:37,009
but another thing that's going to be
very primary to this video series is

67
00:03:37,063 --> 00:03:37,142
thinking about

68
00:03:38,042 --> 00:03:42,084
organizing, I want to say organization,

69
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:45,573
thinking about how you organize your
code, so

70
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:49,670
when we first start we're gonna be
reading very simple instructions,

71
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:52,091
line, fill, which is set a color,

72
00:03:52,091 --> 00:03:55,129
rectangle, ellipse, just for drawing stuff
on the screen

73
00:03:56,029 --> 00:04:00,029
but as we write larger and larger
programs we need to encapsulate

74
00:04:00,029 --> 00:04:03,035
ideas into kinda their own mini-programs
in

75
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:06,130
a way, so, the two kind of key principles

76
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:10,018
of organization that we're going to look at is how
to write a function,

77
00:04:10,045 --> 00:04:13,108
what if we figure out a nice way of
drawing

78
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:17,034
a flower pattern on the screen, right,

79
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:20,066
I can't draw, this is a flower, right,

80
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:23,145
if we figure out how to draw a flower
and we want to have 10 flowers on the

81
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:24,110
screen

82
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,034
are we gonna rewrite all the code for
drawing a flower 10 times, maybe that was

83
00:04:29,043 --> 00:04:31,070
a hundred lines of code just to get this
pattern,

84
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:35,089
could we just take this entire idea of a
flower and put it in its own function

85
00:04:36,052 --> 00:04:39,115
so that anytime you want a flower on
screen we have a new command so to speak

86
00:04:40,015 --> 00:04:40,086
we can just say

87
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:43,118
"flower", and even more than this idea of
functions, a

88
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:47,030
key principle we wanna look at is objects,

89
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:50,005
object-oriented programming. This, to me,

90
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:54,034
is one of the ways that I really
started to feel comfortable writing

91
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:54,087
software,

92
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,113
is once I got to the point of learning
object-oriented programming

93
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:02,087
and understanding something and the
screen treating at in this way we look

94
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:02,181
at the world,

95
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:07,118
this is an object this object had data
associated with it,

96
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:13,076
its color is black, it is a dry erase
marker, that may be a

97
00:05:13,076 --> 00:05:16,144
piece of data, rather than a permanent
marker, and it has functionality,

98
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:21,091
this thing I could say draw, I could take
its cap on and off, right,

99
00:05:21,091 --> 00:05:25,120
remove cap, add cap, so this idea of taking
something like a flower and turning into

100
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:26,071
an object

101
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:29,170
there's data about this flower, how big
how small is it, what color is it,

102
00:05:30,007 --> 00:05:34,026
and it might have functionality, it could
grow, the pedals could fall,

103
00:05:34,089 --> 00:05:38,091
so this idea of something happening in a
computer graphics application

104
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:42,093
being packaged up into this object. Now
this sounds very theoretical and grand,

105
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:43,054
or

106
00:05:43,054 --> 00:05:46,136
perhaps confusing right now, but we're
going to get into the details of how to

107
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:51,043
take a program which has variables
and conditionals and loops and all this logic and

108
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:51,128
all this data

109
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:55,066
and how to organize it into a way that
we can just say

110
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:59,078
"hey, there are seed objects and there
are flower objects and there is grass

111
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:00,102
objects and therefore

112
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:04,084
if we were creating some kind of garden
simulation,

113
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:07,087
for example. So these are all the things
we want to learn.

114
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:11,031
In some programming courses,

115
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:13,610
something like object-oriented
programming might be something that comes

116
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:16,960
very very late in the game, almost
at the very end or

117
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:19,825
perhaps in like a second semester even as
an advanced topic, but we're going to get to

118
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:20,743
objects

119
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,560
pretty quickly because I want that to be
a fundamental way

120
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:28,061
that we look at creating examples and
creating projects in Processing, so

121
00:06:29,006 --> 00:06:32,865
this is kinda, this is the list of
fundamentals, right,

122
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:36,620
these are kind of computer science
fundamentals, I use the word computer

123
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:36,631
science

124
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,196
I, like, "demerit!", my goal is to

125
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,800
never mention the term computer science in
any these videos, anyway, I'll go

126
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,527
off on that ran or tangent, not rant, 
I don't like "rant",

127
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:50,830
but anyway, edit this out please,
somebody, okay,

128
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:53,192
so these are the fundamentals, the things

129
00:06:53,939 --> 00:06:57,980
that will transfer to any
programming language and environment, these are

130
00:06:58,349 --> 00:07:01,840
the kind of core elements, we want to understand
these in great detail,

131
00:07:01,084 --> 00:07:05,723
without any fear or sadness, we just want to
feel happy and comfortable about all these things

132
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,497
and start to practice

133
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,050
writing programs,

134
00:07:11,005 --> 00:07:14,027
but once we get through this I also want to
take a look at

135
00:07:14,027 --> 00:07:19,136
some applications, so what are some types
of things that one might do, for example

136
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:22,458
I really wanna look at images, how do we
load images

137
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,620
and draw images to the screen, how do we read

138
00:07:26,062 --> 00:07:30,291
the pixels of an image and manipulate
and do image processing, how do we do the

139
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:32,250
kinds of things that might happen

140
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:35,043
in a piece software like Photoshop, how do we write
that stuff from scratch

141
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:39,046
with code, what happens if we use a
moving image like a camera

142
00:07:39,046 --> 00:07:42,093
or a video, can we do things like
computer vision,

143
00:07:42,093 --> 00:07:46,158
how do we write
software that can find somebody's face,

144
00:07:47,058 --> 00:07:50,697
how do we write software that can track
the skeleton, the human body, with the

145
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:51,770
Kinect,

146
00:07:51,077 --> 00:07:54,102
so I wanna have a set of
videos about

147
00:07:55,002 --> 00:07:58,881
images and pixels. I also want to look
at

148
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:03,935
data as a topic, so what does it
mean to load data into a program

149
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,430
what are the kinds of ways
of loading data, there's

150
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:10,052
plain text, and XML, and JSON,

151
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,932
and there are all sorts of

152
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,220
data classes in Processing that allow
you to load data, parse data,

153
00:08:19,022 --> 00:08:22,084
and draw stuff based on that data, so what
does it mean to connect to,

154
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,088
you know, data that's local versus data
that on a server,

155
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:30,090
I wanna look at a whole set examples,
what does it mean to work with text,

156
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:33,071
strings, what does it mean to read a
novel and count all the words

157
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:38,060
in that novel, to do a concordance, so I
wanna have a set of videos that

158
00:08:39,032 --> 00:08:42,115
deal with data, and I haven't made these videos yet,

159
00:08:43,015 --> 00:08:46,024
so I totally don't know exactly what we're gonna do,
we could think about, what about 3D

160
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,120
graphics, so I guess what I meant

161
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:51,007
is like topics, so this video series is
going to

162
00:08:51,007 --> 00:08:56,019
start with the fundamentals, all the
fundamental tools of computation, and in there

163
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:57,089
we're also going to have to learn about

164
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:02,055
pixels and drawing and color and shape,
some basic computer graphic stuff, but

165
00:09:02,082 --> 00:09:05,178
really we're going to focus on these
fundamental core concepts of computation,

166
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:09,084
and from there, once we have all this bag
of tricks

167
00:09:09,084 --> 00:09:12,123
we're going to reinforce those ideas, do
them over and over again, practice with

168
00:09:13,023 --> 00:09:13,056
them

169
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:16,114
through a set of topics, images, pixels,
data,

170
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:20,079
3S graphics, I could come up
with some others

171
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,107
but is a pretty good starting point
right now.

172
00:09:24,007 --> 00:09:28,012
Integration with the web, perhaps,
what is this landscape

173
00:09:28,057 --> 00:09:31,065
of, could we do Processing on the web,
there's this thing called Processing.js,

174
00:09:31,065 --> 00:09:32,110
which is JavaScript,

175
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:36,020
we might try to look at that at
some point in the video series.

176
00:09:36,029 --> 00:09:39,071
So I think I'm kind of done with talking
about this but

177
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,123
just to kind of like walk through the
order, this is gonna help me, you can stop,

178
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:45,050
I'm just gonna organize my own
thoughts, and

179
00:09:45,005 --> 00:09:49,059
I'm gonna keep recording, why not, right,
this might be a bad idea,

180
00:09:50,004 --> 00:09:53,068
okay, so, we're in the intro

181
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:57,104
videos right now, so we're kind of going to be done
with the intro videos

182
00:09:58,004 --> 00:10:01,098
and actually we're gonna, I guess there's something
right before that which is the basics

183
00:10:01,098 --> 00:10:04,127
drawing in Processing, which we're going
to start with, I'll call this like

184
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:08,096
"1", this will be "2", once we get through the
basics of drawing,

185
00:10:08,096 --> 00:10:11,105
we're going to look at variables, that'll
be the sort of

186
00:10:12,005 --> 00:10:15,043
videos called number three, then, this
would be like

187
00:10:15,043 --> 00:10:19,107
if this were a course, if you were
taking a class,

188
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:24,071
if this were anything other than just me
in this weird room rambling,

189
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:27,149
then this would be like week one,
week two, week three, and in fact these

190
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:31,080
videos are intended to go along with
this course that I am teaching here which is

191
00:10:31,008 --> 00:10:35,040
divided into weeks, and this would
really actually be week one, intro and

192
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:36,064
drawing,

193
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:39,070
so I'll keep that, so this
would be variables,

194
00:10:40,024 --> 00:10:44,077
then we're going to look at
conditionals and loops,

195
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:47,131
after that we will get

196
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:51,077
to arrays, I think I got this right,

197
00:10:51,077 --> 00:10:56,124
and then after that we will look at
functions, after that we will look at

198
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,087
objects. So it's kind of like half a
semester,

199
00:11:00,087 --> 00:11:04,178
six weeks, this is grossly accelerated
in many ways,

200
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:09,078
you need a lifetime to really master all
this stuff,

201
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:12,166
I need lots more time myself, but this will be

202
00:11:13,066 --> 00:11:16,160
a kind of six-week or six video
sections

203
00:11:17,006 --> 00:11:20,064
through all these topics, and again after
that, seven

204
00:11:21,018 --> 00:11:25,039
would be images, eight would be data, maybe
I'll do that in a different order, nine would be 3D

205
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,039
graphics, so

206
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,118
we'll kinda get to all this
stuff.

207
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:33,057
Okay, so this hopefully gives you a
nice overview,

208
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:36,105
I've kind of wrapped up this introductory
stuff, I feel like these were

209
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:40,061
kind of challenging videos to make in the
sense that they're very

210
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:45,062
kinda, it's less kind of how-to add
looking at stuff step by step and more

211
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:48,117
just kinda rambling through general
concepts, and I feel like I missed so many

212
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:50,020
things I meant to say,

213
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:53,093
so someday I may go back and add things in

214
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,136
or write some stuff in the
descriptions but if something is missing

215
00:11:57,036 --> 00:11:58,071
or something is confusing you,

216
00:11:58,071 --> 00:12:02,077
please, at this point I guess your way
to interact is to use the comments,

217
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:05,124
write a comment, ask a question there
and we could start with a

218
00:12:06,024 --> 00:12:07,035
dialogue that way,

219
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:10,099
although the videos may end up also
somewhere else embedded

220
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:13,150
into some sort of site that has them as well.
Okay,

221
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:17,154
so that's that so I will see you

222
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:20,730
another time, I thank you, I bid you

223
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:23,141
"adieu," apparently I'm
getting into some French stuff in these

224
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:24,092
videos

225
00:12:24,092 --> 00:12:25,161
okay, au revoir!
